<h2>EECS 345: Programming Language Concepts</h2>
<h2>Programming Exercise 2</h2>
<h3>Due Sunday, February 21</h3>

<p>For questions 1-8, write Scheme definitions for the following functions using
continuation passing style
(CPS). The continuation argument should be the last argument. For example, if
you were asked to write factorial, the ''normal'' recursive function is:
</p><pre>(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
</pre>
and so your answer should be
<pre>(define factorial-cps
  (lambda (n return)
    (if (zero? n)
        (return 1)
        (factorial-cps (- n 1) (lambda (v) (return (* n v)))))))
</pre><p></p>

<p>You do not have to convert simple scheme built-in non-recursive functions like <tt>null?</tt>,
<tt>eq?</tt>, <tt>list?</tt>, <tt>number?</tt>, <tt>car</tt>, <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>cdr</tt> to
CPS, but all other helper functions you create should be in CPS.</p>

<ol>

<li><tt>dotproduct</tt> takes a two vectors (lists of numbers) and
computes the dot product of the vectors. If one list is longer than the
other, you can ignore the extra numbers of the longer list. <br>
<pre>&gt; (dotproduct '(1 2 3) '(-2 1 5))
15
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>removesubsequence</tt> takes two lists of atoms. The first list is a <em>subsequence</em>
 of the second list. The method should return the second list with the
first occurence of the subsequence removed. So, if the first list is <tt>'(a b c)</tt>, the first <tt>a</tt> if the second list is removed, the first <tt>b</tt> that appears after the removed <tt>a</tt> is removed, and the first <tt>c</tt> that appears after the removed <tt>b</tt> is removed.<br>
<pre>&gt; (removesubsequence '(1 3 5) '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6))
(0 2 4 6)
&gt; (removesubsequence '(1 3 5) '(5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5))
(5 4 3 2 2 4)
&gt; (removesubsequence '(a b c) '(d b c a c b a b c))
(d b c c a b)
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>squareroot</tt> takes two numbers, a value and an iteration.  The iteration will be an integer greater than or equal to 0.
The method will compute the squareroot of the value using <em>iteration</em> rounds of Newton's method, starting with an initial value equal to the input value.<br>
Newton's method is new = old - ((old * old) - value) / (2 * old)<br>
<pre>&gt; (squareroot 5.0 0)
5.0
&gt; (squareroot 5.0 1)
3.0
&gt; (squareroot 5.0 5)
2.236067977499978
&gt; (squareroot 5 5)
2 514229/2178309
</pre></li>

<li><tt>replaceall*</tt> takes two atoms and a nested list and replaces every occurrence of the first atom with the second
<pre>&gt; (replaceall* 'a 'x '(a (a (a b) c) a))
(x (x (x b) c) x)
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>reverse*</tt> takes a nested list and reverses the contents of the list and all nested lists
<pre>&gt; (reverse* '(a b (c (d e ((f) g)) h)))
((h ((g (f)) e d) c) b a)
</pre></li>

<li><tt>vectormult</tt> takes a row vector (a list of numbers) and
matrix (a list of lists of numbers) and multiplies the vector times the
matrix. The result is a vector where the ith element of the result is
the dotproduct of the input vector and the ith column of the matrix. You
 can assume that the length of the vector matches the number of rows of
the matrix.<br>
<pre>&gt; (vectormult '(1 2 -1) '((0 2 3) (1 2 0) (1 0 3)))
(1 6 0)
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>matrixmultiply</tt> takes two matrices (a list of lists of
numbers) and multiplies them. You can assume the number of columns of
the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix.<br> in the same sublist<br>
<pre>&gt; (matrixmultiply '((1 0 1) (1 1 1) (0 1 1)) '((2 3 4) (-1 1 2) (3 1 -2)))
((5 4 2) (4 5 4) (2 2 0))
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>removesubsequence*</tt>
 takes a list of atoms and a general list.  The first list is a <em>subsequence</em> of the second list.  The method should return the second list
with the first occurence of the subsequence removed.  So, if the first list is <tt>'(a b c)</tt>, the first <tt>a</tt> if the second list is removed, the first <tt>b</tt>
that appears after the removed <tt>a</tt> is removed, and the first <tt>c</tt> that appears after the removed <tt>b</tt> is removed - no matter how deep the atoms are nested.<br>
<pre>&gt; (removesubsequence* '(a b) '(w (x b) ((a) ((y z))) b))
(w (x b) (() ((y z))))
</pre>
<p>As a hint, you need to keep track of two values between recursive calls.  So use two values in the continuation function: <tt>(removesubsequence*-cps '(a b) '(w (x b) ((a) ((y z))) b) (lambda (v1 v2) v2))</tt></p></li>

<li><strong>Write the following function without external helper functions or additional parameters.</strong>
You may use <tt>letrec</tt> to create an internal helper function that uses continuation passing style.
<br>
The function <tt>suffix</tt> takes an atom and a list and returns a list containing all elements
that occur <em>after</em> the last occurrence of the atom.
<pre>(suffix 'x '(a b c))  ==&gt; (a b c)
(suffix 'x '(a b x c d x e f)) ==&gt; (e f)
</pre>
</li>

<li><strong>Write a second version of suffix that uses <tt>call/cc</tt> instead of the "normal" continuation passing style.</strong>
You may not use external helper functions or additional parameters, but you may use <tt>letrec</tt>.
<pre>(suffix2 'x '(a b c))  ==&gt; (a b c)
(suffix2 'x '(a b x c d x e f)) ==&gt; (e f)
</pre>
</li>

</ol>
